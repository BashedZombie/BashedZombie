Heyo! We've a fictive heavy DID system!
**Medically recongised.**
This is not an excuse, but we won't remember everyone we have talked to, don't take it personal.
You can call us Zombie, Skeleton or any nickname you come up with (as long as it's reasonable)
More in-depth information is in our carrd & pronouns.cc, one holds information, the other holds frequent fronters. I implore you to check them out if you want to talk to us.

DNI OR IWEC?!

- Basic DNI!
- Pro shippers, etc (DNI)
- Endo systems (DNI)
- IRLs of characters (DNI)
- Ages 17 or younger (DNI)
- BSD & CRK fans are on THIN ice (IWEC)
- We will never interact first with those fandoms.
- Ships we disagree with (Not a DNI just don't expect us to talk about them or act interested.(e.g. Most Norton ships, Nakahara Chuuya ships, Zanka x Jabber, etc. Ask if you're interested)
- Genderbends or feminizations of characters that are not canon or alter/system based. (DNI)

**BFYI** You should know...

- Despite being in the bsd fandom, we will never interact with others fully if they're sitting as a cos of a character, espeically Nakaharas. You've ruined the character so much I refuse to talk to anyone who only sees his fanon version.
- If you've read the BSD manga and other BOOKS then feel free to interact. 
- We will never see IRLs or FictKins as the actual character. We will not be feeding into any delusions and will use strictly nicknames for you.
- We do not add people unless we've spoken at least once or twice! This includes adding us on Discord.
- We're sexually repulsed and jokes make us heavily uncomfortable. If we have hidden you that is likely the reason. Yes, this includes the act of humping your ponytown friend.
- We will hide you if you feminize a character or see only their fanon version. This includes sexualising them or babying them.
- I do not support MSI but we like their songs.
