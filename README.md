Heyo! We've a fictive heavy DID system!
**Medically recongised.**
This is not an excuse, but we won't remember everyone we have talked to, don't take it personal.

You can call us Zombie, Skeleton or any nickname you come up with (as long as it's reasonable)

More in-depth information is in our carrd & pronouns.cc, one holds information, the other holds frequent fronters. I implore you to check them out if you want to talk to us.

**BFYI** You should know...

- Despite being in the bsd fandom, we will never interact with others fully if they're sitting as a cos of a character, espeically Nakaharas. You've ruined the character so much I refuse to talk to anyone who only sees his fanon version.
- Some of our fictives don't like doubles.
- We will never see IRLs or FictKins as the actual character. We will not be feeding into any delusions and will use strictly nicknames for you.
- We do not add people unless we've spoken at least once or twice! This includes adding us on Discord.
- We're sexually repulsed and jokes make us heavily uncomfortable. If we have hidden you that is likely the reason.
